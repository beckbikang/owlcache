Considering the cost of the connection from the very beginning of the design, the easiest way.
## TCP
* Any client that supports TCP can link to the server.
* Note that TCP connections are not open for password security, so you should decide whether to block the TCP port of the server or disable the TCP service directly in the configuration file.

Simple debugging can use tools such as telnet, or you can write your own client program. For the specific communication interaction protocol, please refer to the chapter "Protocol" and "Command" in the document.

## HTTP
* Any client that supports HTTP can connect to the server.
* The way HTTP connections are in the main direction of owlcache is also recommended for this connection.

Simple debugging can use browsers, CURL and other tools, or you can write your own HTTP client program. For the specific communication interaction protocol, please refer to the chapter "Communication Protocol" and "Operation Command" in the document.
